AutoDank is a python script to automate grinding commands for Dank Memer Discord Bot.
Commands included:
pls beg
pls hunt (work for dragon)
pls dig (Still in testing for monster boss)
pls fish catch (simple fishing)
pls hl
pls postmemes
pls crime
pls search
pls tidy

I use pixels coordinates for detection and moving cursor. My monitor's resolution is 1080x1920 and I use only one monitor.
If you have multiple please feel free to edit the codes.
I also use pytesseract for OCR, you need to download it.

Notes:
Will work flawlessly (I guess) if your internet connection and the bot's response is fast enough.
Will sometimes got padlocked as your buttons did not show fast enough to be autoclicked and the script continues with other commands.

Edit:
I have put this python project on hold, instead I convert it to cpp
